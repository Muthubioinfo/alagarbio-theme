# Alagar Biotech Jekyll Theme

Alagar Biotech Jekyll Theme is designed based on Business Jekyll theme ported over by [Melvin Ch'ng](http://melvinchng.github.io) for Jekyll support. The original source code can be obtained from [Business Jekyll theme](http://melvinchng.github.io) and Technext's [repository](https://github.com/technext/office).

This theme is a package that you can use for your business. I reorganized all the files and make it Jekyll friendly.

## Installation
1. For first time user, you have to install Ruby and Rails. If you do not have Ruby on Rails installed, you may follow [this tutorial](http://melvinchng.github.io/rails/RubyOnRailsInstallation.html) that I wrote for Windows, Linux, and MacOS (installation videos are included).
2. Install Jekyll by using the command `gem install jekyll`.
3. Start your localhost server by using the command `jekyll serve`. Make sure that you are at the root directory of your folder before using this command.
4. Your site should be accessible at `localhost:4000`.
5. For additional information about Jekyll, refer to the [official website](http://jekyllrb.com/).
